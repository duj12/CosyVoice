那有哪些美剧是不太适合学英语的呢？我来给大家举几个例子吧。
第一个《破产姐妹》，我不知道为什么总有人推荐这一部，我先声明一下，我真的很喜欢很喜欢破产姐妹，它真的很下饭。
我大学有一段时间就是天天去食堂打包吃的，然后回到宿舍，我就边看边吃，甚至听到她那个片头曲，我就会很有食欲，但是我真的真的没有办法用它来学英语。
一个是语速太快了；第二全是开车的台词，你说是生活中、考试试中哪儿会用到？所以我觉得破产姐妹下饭必备，学英语还是算了。
The problems of efficiency today are less drastic but more chronic, they can also prolong the evils that they were intended to solve and took the electronic medical record.
It seemed to be the answer to the problem of doctors handwriting, and it had the benefit of providing much better data for treatments.
In practice, it has meant much more electronic paperwork and physicians are now complaining that they have less rather than more time to see patients individually.
The obsession with efficiency can actually make us less efficient.
